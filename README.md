# carRentalz
MERN Stack Application, includes 3d renderings of cars. Frontend React incomplete, backend functionality complete.

Refactoring of Pages folder in frontend portion. 
Refactoring of components section.
Code-Clean up is necessary in frontEnd

BackEnd functionality entirely complete, however OpenAuthentication with Google does not work as of right now.
Must fix OAuth section.

Next few updates will include making a call to a vehicles API to render them to our home page instead of having a temporary 
data object that gets rendered.
